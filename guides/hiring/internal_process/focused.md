# Focused Interview

The [Who Interview](who.md) is comprehensive and will get you most of the way toward the right answer of who to hire. Conduct it in tandem with a colleague, and the two of you will have a rich dataset to work from. In fact, many great hires made on the basis of this interview alone.

Focused interviews allow you to gather additional, specific information about your candidate. In essence, you are turning the magnification up another notch so you can give would-be hires one last look with a finer degree of granularity.

These interviews also offer a chance to involve other team members directly in the hiring process. We think there’s great value in that, but a few cautions first. Be sure to emphasize to your team that this is not meant to be another Who Interview. One time through a candidate’s full story is enough. Stress, too, that everyone is to follow the script. Otherwise, some of your colleagues might fall back on their favorite voodoo hiring methods. That’s the last thing you need at this point.

#### Focused Interview Guide

> 1. The purpose of this interview is to talk about ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
> 2. What are your biggest accomplishments in this area during your career?
> 3. What are your insights into your biggest mistakes and lessons learned in this area?

The focused interview is similar to the commonly used behavioral interview with one major difference: it is focused on the outcomes and competencies of the scorecard, not some vaguely defined job description or manager’s intuition. You have a good idea who you want by this point, but you still need to be as certain as you can that candidate and position are a perfect match. The focused interview is, in essence, your odds enhancer.

The questions follow a simple structure, just like the other interviews in the A Method (see box above). We recommend leading with these primary questions to get the conversation started. As with all of the interviews we present in this book, get curious after every answer by using the “What? How? Tell me more” framework, and keep asking until you understand what the person did and how he or she did it.
