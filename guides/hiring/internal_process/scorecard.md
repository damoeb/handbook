# Candidate Scorecard

The first failure point of hiring is not being crystal clear about what you really want the person you hire to accomplish. To address this, we use a candidate scorecard, which is a document that describes exactly what we want a person to accomplish in a role. 

The scorecard is composed of three parts: the jobâ€™s mission, outcomes, and competencies. Together, these three pieces describe A* performance in the role, what a person must accomplish, and how. 

They provide a clear linkage between the people we hire and our business strategy.
