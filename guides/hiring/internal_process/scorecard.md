# Candidate Scorecard

The scorecard is a document that describes exactly what you want a person to accomplish in a role. It is not a job description, but rather a set of outcomes and competencies that define a job done well. By defining A performance for a role, the scorecard gives you a clear picture of what the person you seek needs to be able to accomplish.

* The first failure point of hiring is not being crystal clear about what you really want the person you hire to accomplish.
