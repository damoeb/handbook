#Our Internal Hiring Process

As a company, we share responsibility for hiring across the team. This helps to get differing opinions and shared insights, but also introduces some challenges and lack of confidence around our hirind to a bit of a voodoo hiring process. 

In terms of specific problems:

- We all approach screening differently.
- We all approach interviewing differently.
- We don't get a full picture of a candidates strengths / weaknesses following our interviews.
- We don't know what people have / haven't covered in previous interviews. 
- Our decision making is primarily gut feeling. 
- We only really interview for technical ability.
- We don't factor in things like alignment with company values, candidate success in previous companies etc. 
- We don't have clear commercial objective for a candidate.
- We don't check references.

In order to improve this, I've been looking at a new internal hiring process, which we should use for screening and face to face interviews. The thinking behind this new approach largely comes from a book called "Who" and some discussions I had at 10kSMB last week.
